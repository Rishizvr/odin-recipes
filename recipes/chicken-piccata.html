        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice </li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li> tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic 
                wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, 
                salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off 
                any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until 
                browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to 
                a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release 
                brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the 
                bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, 
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; 
                cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 
                2 minutes. Serve with sauce over the top.</li>
        </ol>
